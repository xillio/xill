Run a concurrent pipeline of robots.
This construct will set up the concurrency framework in which multiple instances of robots can be
connected to each other using queues. These robots will then start processing in parallel which allows
a xill programmer to utilize all the available resources.

## Workers
This framework is based on the principle of workers. These workers are represented by single xill robots
and their responsibility is to take input and/or provide output. Intuitively there are 3 types of workers.
Check out the examples to see code for each of the types.

### Provider
The provider will generally be the first type of worker. The sole responsibility of this worker is to provide
the first unit of work. An example of this would be a file scraper for a file system analysis or an indexer
for an ecm migration. Providers do not take input but must provide output.

### Transformer
The transformer can have a variety of responsibilities. It will take input, modify it in some way and then
output the modified value. An example of this would be the attribute reader for file system analysis or
a html source cleaner for web migrations. Transformers must consume all input and provide output.

**Tip:** To boost the performance of your transformers you should try to only use one main type of resource.
(File IO, Database IO, CPU, etc...) This will allow that resource to be utilized completely while the other
workers can still keep running.

### Consumer
The consumer is responsible for processing the results of a pipeline. Generally this is the last robot
of the pipeline and most of the times it will store the results in a database.
