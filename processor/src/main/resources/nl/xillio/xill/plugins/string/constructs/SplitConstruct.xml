Splits `string` into a LIST of strings, based on the provided `delimiter`.

`delimiter` is interpreted as a Java Regular expression. Since all backslash "\" characters will be interpreted (by the Xill IDE) as an escape character, all forward slashes you want to be evaluated by the regex have to be doubled.
This means that "\\" would denote a single literal backslash "\" and "\*" would denote a literal asterisk "*".

Empty entries are skipped by default. You can optionally set `keepempty` to `true` to also add empty entries to the resulting list.
