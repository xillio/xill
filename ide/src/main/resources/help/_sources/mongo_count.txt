**mongo_count (**\ *string* **collection,** *<list,void>* **query*,** *string* **mongo*)**

Description
-----------

Counts the number of objects in ``collection`` that match ``query``. If ``query`` is ``null`` or not specified it will count all objects in ``collection``. If ``mongo`` is not provided the last active connection will be used.

Examples
--------

-

    Counting the amount of objects in the "furniture" collection:
    
    ::
    
        mongo_connect("localDB");
        fCount = mongo_count("furniture");
        log("Furniture count: " + fCount);
    
    Will print:
    
    ::
    
        Furniture count: 1049

-

    Counting the amount of objects in the "furniture" collection with "height" >= 100.
    
    ::
    
        mongo_connect("localDB");
        
        //Note that because "$gte" starts with a dollar sign it needs to be wrapped in quotes, while "height" does not.
        high = { height = { "$gte" = 100 } };
        highFurniture = mongo_count("furniture", high);
        log("High furniture count: " + highFurniture);
    
    Will print:
    
    ::
    
        High furniture count: 759
