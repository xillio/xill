**exiftool (**\ *string* **uri,** *string* **encoding*,** *number* **timeout*)**

Description
-----------

Executes ``exiftool`` on file located at ``uri``. Returns a list of extracted metadata tags and their values. Optionally, the encoding of the filename and metadata can be set through ``encoding``. By default it is set to 'ISO-8859-1' for Windows users and 'UTF-8' for every other OS. Exiftool will automatically time-out after 30 seconds, you can optionally specify a different ``timeout`` in seconds. A timeout of 0 indicates that you do not want ``exiftool`` to time out.

**NOTE**: Windows only supports filenames with 'ISO-8859-1' encoded characters. Use external exiftool executable with the ``runprogram()`` function if you run into encoding issues.
On Mac and Linux systems you must download and install exiftool from http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ or using your preferred package manager, then make sure exiftool is available in your path. See the INSTALLATION notes for more information. An alternative is to use :doc:`metadatafromdocument`
