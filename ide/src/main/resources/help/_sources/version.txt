    Executing the following code:
    
    ::
    
        v = version();
        log (v);

    will print:
    
    ::
    
        1.6.4

    Note: your version number may differ.

    Running the following on Xillio Content Tools version 1.4.1:
    
    ::
    
        version("1.6");
        log("Version test passed.");

    will print 
    
    ::
    
        Incompatible version: 1.4.1. Required for robot: 1.6
    
    while running in version 1.6 it would print:
    
    ::
    
        Version test passed.
