**mongo_delete (**\ *string* **collection,** *<string,list,void>* **query*,** *string* **mongo*)**

Description
-----------

Delete objects from ``collection`` using ``query``. If ``query`` is a string, it will delete the document with that id, otherwise it will delete all objects that match the query. See below for required syntax of a mongo query. If ``mongo`` is not provided the last active connection will be used.

Examples
--------

-

    Deleting the document with id "John_Doe_1" from the "employees" collection:
    
    ::
    
        mongo_connect("localDB");
        result = mongo_delete("employees", "John_Doe_1");
        log(result);
    
    Will print:
    
    ::
    
        {
            "rows": 1
        }
-

    Deleting all objects from the "employees" collection where "age" < 18.
    
    ::
    
        mongo_connect("localDB");
        //Note that because "$lt" starts with a dollar sign it needs to be wrapped in quotes, while "age" does not.
        underage = { age = { "$lt" = 18 } };
        result = mongo_delete("employees", underage);
    
    Will print:
    
    ::
    
        {
            "rows": 27
        }
