**es_statsagg (**\ *string* **name,** *string* **field,** *<string,void>* **parent*)**

Description
-----------

Creates an aggregation ``name`` containing the minimum, maximum, average, sum and count for ``field`` as a child of the aggregation ``parent``. Returns a string identifier that can be used to identify this aggregation.
Two sibling or same-level aggregations cannot have the same name. If a stats aggregation is given a child, that child will not be used. The ``parent`` aggregation must be created with ``es_termsagg()``.

Examples
--------

-

	Create a stats aggregation for the price field.
	
	::
		
		stats = es_statsagg("stats", "price");

-

	Create an aggregation "authors" that includes a field "stats" containing statistics for the "price" field grouped by "author".
	
	::
	
		es_connect();
		//create a new aggregation "authors" which groups by field "author"
		authors = es_termsagg("authors", "author");
		//add the field "stats", which shows the aggregated statistics
		es_statsagg("stats", "price", authors);
		results = es_aggregate("art", null, authors);
