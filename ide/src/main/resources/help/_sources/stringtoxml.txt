-   
    
    Executing the following code
    
    ::
    
        content = "<note id=\"1\">
                    <to>Tove</to>
                    <from>Jani</from>
                    <heading>Reminder</heading>
                    <comment>This was sent to James as well</comment>
                    <comment>John has not responded to the invitation</comment>
                    <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
                </note>";

        xmlcontent = stringtoxml (content);

        comments = xpath (xmlcontent, "//comment");

        log (comments);
    
    will print:
    
    ::
    
		{
			0 = <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
				<comment>This was sent to James as well</comment>,
			1 = <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
				<comment>John has not responded to the invitation</comment>
		}

    However, trying to execute this line:
    
    ::
    
        comments = xpath (content, "//comment");
        
    will throw an error.
