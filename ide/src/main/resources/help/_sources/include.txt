**include (**\ *<string,list>* **libraries)**

Description
-----------

Includes the listed library or libraries without executing any code. ``libraries`` is a string containing one file uri or a list containing several strings with file uri's. After including a library the routines inside that library become part of the current robot.

Examples
--------

-
    
    Executing the following code:
    
    ::
    
        include ("testbots/routines.sbot");

        log (cleanurlsimple("www.xillio.com/#main?parameter=test", true, true));    

    will print:
    
    ::
    
        www.xillio.com

    Assuming we have a text file ``routines.sbot``, which contains the following:
    
    ::
    
        cleanurlsimple = routine(url, stripanchors, stripvars) {
            if (stripanchors == true) {
                url = replace(url, "#.*", ""); // strip anchors
            }
            if (stripvars == true) {
                url = replace(url, "\?.*|\&.*|target=.*", ""); // strip appended variables
            }
            url = replace(url, "/$", ""); // strip trailing slash
            url = urldecode(url);
            
            return(url);
        }

        geturl = routine (url) {
            // gets the url from a loadpage errormessage (assumes it is at the end of the message)
            result = regex (url, ".*(https?://.*$)|.*(www\\..*$)");
            if (variabletype (result) == "list") {
                return (result [1]);
            }
            return (null);
        }

    We could also include the above code as two separate libraries, by splitting them into two separate files ``cleanurl.sbot`` and ``geturl.sbot``:
    
    ::
    
        include ({"testbots/cleanurl.sbot", "testbots/geturl.sbot"});
    
    Note that the latter is probably the most modular and maintainable way of including routines, while the former seems more convenient.
