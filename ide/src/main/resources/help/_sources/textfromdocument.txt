    Suppose you have a document at ``path`` containing the following content:
    
    ::
    
            Document Title
            +---+ I am a word document which
            |IMG| you need to do some operations 
            +---+ on.
            

    Then ``textfromdocument(path)`` will return:
    
    ::
    
            Document Title
            I am a word document which you need to do some operations on.
