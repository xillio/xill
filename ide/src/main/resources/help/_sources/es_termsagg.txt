	Create an aggregation "authors" that includes a field "stats" containing statistics for the "price" field grouped by "author":
	
	::
	
		es_connect();
		//create a new aggregation "authors" which groups by field "author"
		authors = es_termsagg("authors", "author");
		//add the field "stats", which shows the aggregated statistics for the field "price"
		es_statsagg("stats", "price", authors);
		results = es_aggregate("art", null, authors);
