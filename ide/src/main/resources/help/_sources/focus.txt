    ::

        page = loadpage ("http://www.xillio.com/");

        if (page != null) {
            node = xpath (page, "//input[@name='q']"); // select the search box at the top of the Xillio homepage
            focus (node); // set focus to that box
        } else {
            log ("no page");
        }
