**substring (**\ *<string,number>* **text,** *number* **start,** *number* **end*)**

Description
-----------

Returns the substring of string ``text`` between integer positions ``start`` and position ``end``. The first character in the string is numbered 0. The last character returned by ``substring`` is the character before position ``end``. Optionally ``end`` can be left out, which means the returned string will end at the last position of ``text``.

Example
-------

    ::
            
        log(substring("Welcome to our site!", 0, 7));
        log(substring("Welcome to our site!", 0));
        
    will print:
    
    ::
    
        Welcome
        Welcome to our site!
