**es_termfilter (**\ *string* **field,** *string* **term)**

Description
-----------

Select all documents containing at least one occurrence of ``term`` in ``field``. Returns a string identifier that can be used to identify this filter. 
If the document does not have ``field``, it will not be included in the search query. 

**NOTE:** This filter sees ``term`` as a single term and compares it against all the terms (usually single words, depending on the tokenizer) in the content of ``field``. 
By default, this means that using multiple words as ``term`` will not yield any results. (E.g. 'green grass' as ``term`` will not find 'grass' or 'green'.)

Examples
--------

-

	Search for documents of type "guides", containing the term "elastic" in field "content":
	
	::
	
		es_connect();
		contentFilter = es_termfilter("content", "elastic");
		result = es_search("documents", "guides", contentFilter);
