**setcell (**\ *sheet* **sheet,** *<void,string,number,boolean,date>* **value,** *<string,number>* **column,** *<string,number>* **row*)**

Description
-----------

Sets ``value`` at cell ``column``, ``row`` in Excel spreadsheet ``sheet``. ``column`` and ``row`` can either be an index number (1,5) , or a readable indicator (A, 5). ``row`` can be omitted by putting the full cell indicator in the second parameter (A5). Note that ``column`` and ``row`` in numeric form are 1-based (counting starts at 1) to make them compatible with string-based lookups.
When ``value`` is of type ``date`` the following format will be applied: ``yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss``. Please note that the provided ``sheet`` will not have its ``row`` and ``column`` counts updated for performance reasons. Use ``getsheet`` afterwards instead.

Example

-
    
    Setting cell values in a spreadsheet:
    
    ::
        
        workbook = createexcel();
        sheet = createsheet(workbook, "Mapping");
        rowsToCreate = 20;
        columnsToCreate = 8;
        rowCounter = 1;
        totalCounter = 1;
        while (rowCounter <= rowsToCreate){
            colCounter = 1;
            while (colCounter <= columnsToCreate){
                setcell(sheet, totalCounter, colCounter, rowCounter);
                totalCounter = totalCounter+1;
                colCounter = colCounter+1;
            }
            rowCounter = rowCounter+1;
        }

    Excel files can be saved by using ``savedata``:
    
    ::
    
        savedata("C:/projects/someproject/mapping/mapping.xls", workbook);
