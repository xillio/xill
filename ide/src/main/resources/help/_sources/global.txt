**global (**\ *any* **value)**

Description
-----------

Set ``value`` as a global variable, which is accessible in all contexts. This means you can create side-effects with global variables. Be careful in using them. Usually only global settings, which are read-only should make use of the ``global`` function. 

Examples
--------

-
    
    Given the text file ``settings.sbot`` which contains the following code:
    
    ::
    
        settings = {
            "baseurl" = "http://www.xillio.com",
            "gxtest_url" = "https://www.xillio.com/web/xilliogximporter",
        };
        return(settings);
        
    executing
    
    ::

        settings = global(callbot("bots/settings.sbot"));
        
    will import the settings array returned by settings.sbot into the object ``settings``.
    
    Now, executing
    
    ::
    
        log (settings.baseurl);

    will print
    
    ::
    
        INFO: http://www.xillio.com
        
    This will always work in any routine or subroutine of the bot. However, the settings object is a variable, not a constant, so changing it will also have immediate effect everywhere.

    Changing a global variable in a routine:
    
    ::
    
        testvalue  = global ("testing");
        
        routine changevalue() {
            testvalue = "testing2";
        }
        
        log (testvalue);
    
    will print:
    
    ::
    
        INFO: testing2
