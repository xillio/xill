**copyfile (**\ *string* **source,** *string* **target)**

Description
-----------

Copies file pointed to by string ``source`` to the location specified by string ``target``. In case of any error the exception is caught and a message is printed to the console. File location must be an absolute path. Either backslashes (Windows convention) or forward slashes may be used in both paths. Backslashes in literal strings have to be escaped as usual.

Example
-------

-

	The following copies the file ``test.txt`` to the (newly created) file ``note.txt``:
	
	::
	
		copyfile ("C:/tmp/test.txt", "C:/tmp/note.txt");
