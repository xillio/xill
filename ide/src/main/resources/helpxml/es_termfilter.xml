  <description><![CDATA[Select all documents containing at least one occurrence of term in field. Returns a string identifier that can be used to identify this filter.If the document does not have field, it will not be included in the search query.NOTE: This filter sees term as a single term and compares it against all the terms (usually single words, depending on the tokenizer) in the content of field.By default, this means that using multiple words as term will not yield any results. (E.g. ‘green grass’ as term will not find ‘grass’ or ‘green’.)]]></description>
